# Classification-of-plant-species-using-leaf-pictures-and-CNN

## Synopsis

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying images of plant
species. Due to the limited availability of images for each species, particularly
with an average of only a hundred images per species, the focus is on optimizing
the model for accuracy and time complexity. A CNN model is constructed for 50
species, and both segmented lab and field images are used for testing.
Additionally, the performance of the popular VGGNet architecture is evaluated
for comparison. The TensorFlow library is used for modeling the CNN, and
techniques such as image augmentation, batch normalization, and regularization
are applied to enhance accuracy. Through iterative testing and refinement, the
best-performing model is identified based on achieved accuracy.


## Abstract:
 There are over half a million plant species in the globe, thus classifying and identifying different plant species is a crucial process. Recently, computer vision has been effectively applied to automated plant categorizing systems. Manual identification needs previous knowledge of species and is a time-consuming operation, thus the atomization approach helps to speed up the traditional way of plant leaf identification. Plants can be grouped and identified according to their reproductive system (flowers) and leaf shape. The suggested proposal aims to include atomization into the process of developing a model that can recognize plant leaf species using a digital picture of a plant leaf. 
 
 Convolutional neural networks are one of the most widely used deep learning techniques for plant leaf classification. The Neural Network would be taught to recognize edges (shape-based classification). The LeafSnap dataset provided a huge number of training samples. Optimizing hyper parameters during training resulted in an accurate rate of around 85% for leaf classification using deep learning's CNN toolkit. CNN applications serve as a benchmark for image processing in botany by enhancing the accuracy of picture classification and recognition. This will aid botanical researchers with their research and speed up the process of identifying plant species.
