# Classification-of-plant-species-using-leaf-pictures-and-CNN

## Synopsis

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying images of plant
species. Due to the limited availability of images for each species, particularly
with an average of only a hundred images per species, the focus is on optimizing
the model for accuracy and time complexity. A CNN model is constructed for 50
species, and both segmented lab and field images are used for testing.
Additionally, the performance of the popular VGGNet architecture is evaluated
for comparison. The TensorFlow library is used for modeling the CNN, and
techniques such as image augmentation, batch normalization, and regularization
are applied to enhance accuracy. Through iterative testing and refinement, the
best-performing model is identified based on achieved accuracy.
